Access Microsoft Graph API with Python

As I was unable to find proper and/or complete Python example's to access the MS Graph API, I figured this out.
I wanted something to access my private e-mail, but without a MS license this doesnt work.
So far I only tested this on Office365 business license, but should work for student aswell.
